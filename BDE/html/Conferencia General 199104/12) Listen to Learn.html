<H1>Listen to Learn</H1><p data-aid="28784093" id="p3">In his invocation for this session of conference, Elder Hugh W. Pinnock prayed that we might listen carefully. Many articles in Church literature have dealt with the important art of listening.<sup class="marker">1</sup> They support a proverb that teaches this vital lesson: “Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise.” (Prov. 19:20.)<sup class="marker">2</sup> Surely wisdom will come as we <em>listen to learn</em> from children, parents, partners, neighbors, Church leaders, and the Lord.</p><section><header><h2 data-aid="28784094" id="title2">Children</h2></header><p data-aid="28784095" id="p4">Parents and teachers, learn to listen, then listen to learn from children. A wise father once said, “I do a greater amount of good when I listen to my children than when I talk to them.”<sup class="marker">3</sup></p><p data-aid="28784096" id="p5">When our youngest daughter was about four years of age, I came home from hospital duties quite late one evening. I found my dear wife to be very weary. I don’t know why. She only had nine children underfoot all day. So I offered to get our four-year-old ready for bed. I began to give the orders: “Take off your clothes; hang them up; put on your pajamas; brush your teeth; say your prayers” and so on, commanding in a manner befitting a tough sergeant in the army. Suddenly she cocked her head to one side, looked at me with a wistful eye, and said, “Daddy, do you own me?”</p><p data-aid="28784097" id="p6">She taught me an important lesson. I was using coercive methods on this sweet soul. To rule children by force is the technique of Satan, not of the Savior. No, we don’t own our children. Our parental privilege is to love them, to lead them, and to let them go.</p><p data-aid="28784098" id="p7">The time to listen is when someone needs to be heard. Children are naturally eager to share their experiences, which range from triumphs of delight to trials of distress. Are we as eager to listen? If they try to express their anguish, is it possible for us to listen openly to a shocking experience without going into a state of shock ourselves? Can we listen without interrupting and without making snap judgments that slam shut the door of dialogue? It can remain open with the soothing reassurance that we believe in them and understand their feelings. Adults should not pretend an experience did not happen just because they might wish otherwise.</p><p data-aid="28784099" id="p8">Even silence can be misinterpreted. A story was written of “a little boy [who] looked up at his mother and said, ‘Why are you mad at me?’ She answered, ‘I’m not angry at you. What makes you say that?’ ‘Well, your hands are on your hips, and you are not saying anything.’”<sup class="marker">4</sup></p><p data-aid="28784100" id="p9">Parents with teenage youth may find that time for listening is often less convenient but more important when young people feel lonely or troubled.

Spiritually or physically, it can be a matter of life and death.</p><p data-aid="28784104" id="p12">Several years ago, I was invited to give an important lecture at a medical school in New York City. The night before the lecture, Sister Nelson and I were invited to dinner at the home of our host professor. There he proudly introduced us to an honor medical student—his beautiful daughter.</p><p data-aid="28784105" id="p13">Some weeks later, that professor telephoned me in an obvious state of grief. I asked, “What is the matter?”</p><p data-aid="28784106" id="p14">“Remember our daughter whom you met at our home?”</p><p data-aid="28784107" id="p15">“Of course,” I replied. “I’ll never forget such a stunning young lady.”</p><p data-aid="28784108" id="p16">Then her father sobbed and said, “Last night she was killed in an automobile accident!” Trying to gain composure, he continued: “She asked permission to go to a dance with a certain young man. I didn’t have a good feeling about it. I told her so and asked her not to go. She asked, ‘Why?’ I simply told her that I was uneasy. She had always been an obedient daughter, but she said that if I could not give her a good reason to decline, she wanted to go. And so she did. At the dance, alcoholic beverages were served. Her escort drank a bit—we don’t know how much. While returning home, he was driving too fast, missed a turn, and careened through a guardrail into a reservoir below. They were both submerged and taken to their death.”</p><p data-aid="28784109" id="p17">As I shared my feeling of sadness, he concluded: “My grief is made worse because I had the distinct feeling that trouble lay ahead. Why couldn’t I have been more persuasive?”</p><p data-aid="28784110" id="p18">This experience will not have been in vain if others can listen and learn from it. Children, honor your parents,<sup class="marker">5</sup> even when they cannot give a satisfactory explanation for their feelings.

I was amused to read of an experience recorded by Elder F. Burton Howard in his biography of President Marion G. Romney: “His good-humored love for Ida was manifested in many ways. He delighted in telling of her hearing loss. ‘I once went to see a doctor about her hearing,’ he would say. ‘He asked me how bad it was, and I said I didn’t know. He told me to go home and find out. The doctor instructed me to go into a far room and speak to her. Then I should move nearer and nearer until she does hear. Following the doctor’s instructions, I spoke to her from the bedroom while she was in the kitchen—no answer. I moved nearer and spoke again—no answer. So I went right up to the door of the kitchen and said, “Ida, can you hear me?” She responded, “What is it, Marion—I’ve answered you three times.”’”<sup class="marker">8</sup></p><p data-aid="28784115" id="p22">Even with normal hearing, some couples seem not to listen to one another. Taking time to talk is essential to keep lines of communication intact. If marriage is a prime relationship in life, it deserves prime time! Yet less important appointments are often given priority, leaving only leftover moments for listening to precious partners.</p><p data-aid="28784116" id="p23">Keeping the garden of marriage well cultivated and free from weeds of neglect requires the time and commitment of love.

On several sacred occasions in the world’s history, our Heavenly Father has personally appeared to introduce His divine Son with a specific charge to “<em>hear</em> him.”<sup class="marker">13</sup></p><p data-aid="28784131" id="p35">Jesus taught this first and great commandment: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” (Matt. 22:37.)</p><p data-aid="28784132" id="p36">Scriptures recorded in all dispensations teach that we show our <em>love</em> of God as we <em>hearken</em> to His commandments and <em>obey</em> them.<sup class="marker">14</sup> These actions are closely connected. In fact, the Hebrew language of the Old Testament in most instances uses the same term for both <em>hearkening</em> (to the Lord) and <em>obedience</em> (to His word).<sup class="marker">15</sup></p><p data-aid="28784133" id="p37">In addition to hearing the word of the Lord obediently, we manifest our love for God through prayer. And listening is an essential part of prayer. Answers from the Lord come ever so quietly. Hence He has counseled us to “be still and know that I am God.” (D&C 101:16.)</p><p data-aid="28784134" id="p38">President Spencer W. Kimball said, “It would not hurt us, either, if we paused at the end of our prayers to do some intense listening—even for a moment or two—always praying, as the Savior did, ‘not my will, but thine, be done.’ (Luke 22:42.)”<sup class="marker">16</sup></p><p data-aid="28784135" id="p39">In a world scarred by scourges of tyranny and war, many of its inhabitants earnestly pray for inner peace. For example, not long ago a beautiful young mother named Svetlana developed an intense desire to obtain a Bible. But in her city of Leningrad, a Bible was very rare and expensive. Frequently and fervently she prayed for a Bible. Ultimately, she and her husband were impressed to travel with their small child to Helsinki, Finland, with that hope in mind. There one day while walking in a park, she stumbled across an object buried under the cover of autumn leaves. She picked it up and found it to be a Bible written in the Russian language! Excitedly she recounted the story of this great discovery to another mother who was also in the park with her youngster. The second mother rejoiced with Svetlana and added, “Would you like to have <em>another</em> book about Jesus Christ?” Svetlana, of course, answered in the affirmative. The other mother provided Svetlana with a copy of a Russian-language edition of the Book of Mormon and invited the family to church. She eagerly embraced the teachings of the missionaries and shortly thereafter joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Then they returned to their home, where they have helped pioneer the work in the Leningrad Branch of the Church.<sup class="marker">17</sup></p><p data-aid="28784136" id="p40">Her experience typifies this promise of the Savior to those who seek Him: “Thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who <em>hearken</em> unto my precepts, and <em>lend an ear</em> unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more.” (2 Ne. 28:30; italics added.)<sup class="marker">18</sup></p><p data-aid="28784137" id="p41">While stressing the importance of listening well, I am mindful of those who cannot hear. Many labeled as deaf have received the Spirit “by the hearing of faith.” (Gal. 3:2.)<sup class="marker">19</sup> The example of Rachel Ivins Grant is inspiring to me. She never complained about her own deafness. Though most women in their seventies would be completely worn out while rearing six growing children of another mother, she undertook that task. Rachel’s deafness seemed to save her from the wear and tear of noise. Sometimes, when two were arguing, Rachel would burst out laughing. She said they had no idea how funny it was to see their angry faces and hear none of their words.</p><p data-aid="28784138" id="p42">Before her son, Heber J. Grant, became the seventh President of the Church, she declared, “Of course the greatest trial I have is that I cannot hear, but I have so many blessings I cannot complain, but if we only will live so that we may receive the instructions of God, there is nothing we are called to pass through but will be for our good.”<sup class="marker">20</sup></p><p data-aid="28784139" id="p43">The Redeemer loves such faithful souls: “For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers.” (1 Pet. 3:12.)</p><p data-aid="28784140" id="p44">They qualify for this prophetic promise: “Before they call, I [the Lord] will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear” (Isa. 65:24).</p><p data-aid="28784141" id="p45">To all of God’s children, either able to hear or deaf to mortal sound, He offers this reward: “Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live.” (Isa. 55:3.)<sup class="marker">21</sup></p><p data-aid="28784142" id="p46">Your soul will be blessed as you learn to listen, then listen to learn from children, parents, partners, neighbors, and Church leaders, all of which will heighten capacity to hear counsel from on high.</p><p data-aid="28784143" id="p47">Carefully listen to learn from the Lord through the still small voice—the Holy Spirit—which leads to truth.<sup class="marker">22</sup> Listen to learn by studying scriptures that record His holy mind and will.<sup class="marker">23</sup> Listen to learn in prayer, for He will answer the humble who truly seek Him.<sup class="marker">24</sup></p><p data-aid="28784144" id="p48">The wise listen to learn from the Lord.

Examples:“They have ears, but they <em>hear</em> not.” (Ps. 135:17; see also Ps. 140:6; italics added.) (‘âzan) to give ear—to listen“I will <em>hear,</em> saith the Lord, I will <em>hear</em> the heavens, and they shall <em>hear</em> the earth.” (Hosea 2:21; italics added.) (‘ânâh) to pay attention—to answer“Lift up thy voice, O daughter … : cause it to be <em>heard.</em>” (Isa. 10:30; italics added; see also Ps. 10:17.) (qâshav) to give heedStill different terms were employed in the Old Testament when referring to obedience <em>not</em> to Deity but to other people. Examples:“The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to <em>obey</em> his mother.” (Prov. 30:17; italics added.) (yiqqâhâh) obedience, to obey“The children of Ammon shall <em>obey</em> them.” (Isa. 11:14; italics added.) (mishma’ath) audience—obedienceThat link between <em>listening</em> and <em>obedience</em> is found not only in Hebrew, but in Latin and Greek. The word <em>obey</em> comes from two Latin roots: the prefix <em>ob</em> “to” or “toward,” and the root <em>audio, audire</em> “to hear” or “to listen.” This root occurs in words such as <em>audio, audience,</em> or <em>auditorium.</em> Literally, then, the word <em>obey</em> means “to hear or to listen <em>toward,</em>” that is, “to comply.”The word for <em>obey</em> in Greek, (hupakouo), literally means “listen under,” from <em>hypo</em> “under” as in <em>hypo-dermic,</em> also “in subjection or subordination” and the root <em>akouo</em> “hear, listen” as in <em>acoustics.</em> In New Testament times, its use was gradually broadened to less sacred realms, including expressions such as “children, obey parents” (see Eph. 6:1; Col. 3:20), “wives, [obey] husbands” (see 1 Pet. 3:1), “servants, obey … masters” (see Col. 3:22), and so on.A parallel pattern is found in the Book of Mormon. Use of terms such as <em>listen, hear,</em> and <em>hearken,</em> written at the time of the Old Testament, generally carried the same implication of obedience to Deity. Those terms in Book of Mormon scriptures written <em>after</em> the earthly advent of Christ were also broadened to include the more familiar usage, as in the language of the New Testament.</p></div><span style="-ms-grid-row:31">16.</span><div style="-ms-grid-row:31"><p data-aid="28784160" id="note16_p1">Spencer W.
